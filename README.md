A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

* Navigation Drawer: Provides a menu for easy navigation to different sections like Home, About, Services, Products, and Works.

* AppBar and Slivers: The app bar contains an image that expands and shrinks as the user scrolls. Content is organized using slivers for smooth scrolling.

* Image Carousels: Two carousels showcase products and client images. The first one slides automatically, while the second one requires manual swiping.

* Drawer Items: The drawer includes various menu items, and tapping on them can be customized to navigate to specific sections in the app.

* Contact Information: The drawer displays contact info that can be expanded or collapsed. It includes the office location, email, and phone number.

* Firebase Authentication: Although not explicitly mentioned in this code, it is a potential integration point. Firebase authentication can be used for user sign-in,  specific implementation details are provided.

* Flutter Toast: The code hints at the use of a custom Toast widget, possibly for displaying short-lived messages or notifications in the app.

* Form Container Widget: There is a reusable FormContainerWidget that simplifies the UI code for email and password input fields, improving code organization.
